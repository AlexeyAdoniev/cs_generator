        The collection is presented by Volt Inu, a multichain ecosystem (Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon) that combines DeFi and Play-to-Earn. It includes a DEX, a P2E racing game, and even an AI-powered utility that interacts with blockchain airdrops. 

        The platform’s token is $VOLT, traded on over 80 exchanges, including Gate.io, Hotbit, and MEXC. The profits earned by various Volt Inu modules are re-directed back into the ecosystem to support the value of $VOLT. The community has a serious say in the governance: for example, in February 2023 token holders voted to burn $75 million worth of VOLT. 
        
        <a href="https://cryptoresearch.report" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Coming back</a> to Volted Dragons NFTs, they have multifaceted utility. On May 18, Volt Inu opened the first VoltiEco staking pool for $VOLT and VSDC NFTs, with attractive rewards. There was a limit of 200 VSDC, and it was reached within minutes
        
        On top of DeFi rewards, Dragon holders get access to a share of the ecosystem’s revenue, the Sailors’ Lounge user area, real-world events, and future NFT mints.
        
        Originally there were 10,000 VDSC NFTs, but the project eventually burned over 5,500 of them, making the collection even more exclusive. Volted Dragons are available on OpenSea with a floor price of 0.33 ETH (around $600). Only 4% of the collection is listed. Indeed, it makes sense for VDSC owners to hold on to their NFTs, considering that more DeFi integrations are planned.
        
        Volted Dragons are also integrated into Volt Inu’s gaming platform, VoltiGames. Together with Forge Universe Blacksmith Labs, Volt Inu created VSDC Battle Royale – a game where you can land in various locations on an island, collect weapons, and fight other players. And yes, your character is a dragon.
        
        The game is currently in Early Access on Steam.
